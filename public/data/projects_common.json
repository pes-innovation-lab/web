Many functionalities, such as GPS, have been made accessible to the masses via mobile devices, and provide accurate results. However, the major drawback of such accuracy is the high amounts of power consumed by the phone. Given the limited battery capacity of such devices, prolonged use of the aforementioned functionalities becomes difficult. Observing this issue, it is clear that there is a need to provide accurate positioning while improving power efficiency. This project aims to achieve accurate tracking of the device location while navigating along a predefined route, relying on the pressure data collected by the barometer sensor present in the smartphone. The algorithm is made accurate using cell tower data collected by the phone on said route.",

The potential benefits of autonomous vehicles are immense: elimination of accidents caused by human errors, a reduction in carbon dioxide emission, more efficient use of energy and infrastructure, among others. This kind of vehicle has become a concrete reality and may pave the way for future systems where computers take over the art of driving. In this paper, we present a 2-model approach for autonomous driving of car in a cityscape. The first model is used to drive the car in a no - traffic lane from an initial start location to the destination. The second model modifies the speed and brake states of the car on detecting obstacles within a specified range. We have trained the models using Reinforcement Learning in a simulator environment provided by CARLA.",

The user is allowed to choose objects via touchscreen interface after it's recognition and segmentation. The real world coordinates of the chosen object is obtained using the point cloud of the FOV of the stereo camera and they are used to find the elevation and azimuth of the servo motors of the foundation of the robotic arm, which actuates and aligns itself with the chosen object. The chosen object's pose is tracked continuously irrespective of the movement of the wheelchair.\nThis acts as a framework for a robotic arm having at least 3 DOF.",

            "long_description": "Over the years, the ways and processes people have employed to consume information and learn have changed in innumerable ways. The biggest change perhaps, is the emergence of the internet as the clear victor as a global source of knowledge. For the sake of argument, the internet may be thought of as a big, disorganised kitchen with many chefs and no particular distribution of dish workload among them. Say chef-A fashions a particularly scrumptious starter dish-X while being moderately skilled at making the main course dish-Y and sadly, makes a rather foul dessert dish-Z. His colleague, chef-B makes a Michelin worthy main course dish-Y but is so-so at the other two components of a meal. Enter chef-C. He makes the best Poire la Beaujolaise (call it dish-Z) but is simply incapable of making anything else. Now, if you wanted a 3-course meal, what are your chances of getting an optimal dish-A, dish-B and dish-C and in that particular order? Bleak indeed. This is pre- cisely the issue that Roadmap solves. Deconstructing the analogy, the chefs are websites and the dishes are resources. Akin to a meal, information must be consumed in a particular order and from the right source(s). Roadmap identifies blocks of prerequisite information pertaining to the desired ob- jective topic and presents a platter of ranked resources procured from apt sources. These tasks are accomplished by parsing through various resources and identifying parent-child relationships between entities by virtue of varied approaches such as semantic nets, N-space clustering, ANNs that analyse the statistical occurrences of entities and even contextualised word embeddings. Going back to the analogy one last time, Roadmap takes structured learning from ”too many chefs spoil the broth” to ”the more the merrier”.",

            "long_description": "Timetable scheduling can be designed as a constraint satisfaction problem and can be solved using various approaches. An optimal solution for a timetable scheduling problem is difficult to find using any generic algorithm, due to the diverse nature of hard constraints and preferences also known as soft constraints, which may vary from institution to institution. Various approaches aimed at finding optimal solutions to such constraint satisfaction problems use constraint optimization, coupled with algorithms such as genetic, swarm particle optimization, tabu search etc. but these approaches are problem dependent and hence are infeasible in real-world situations. In this project, a pure Linear Constrained Optimization approach consisting of integer programming using binary variables has been explored. The developed solver class was tested using real-world data gathered from the various departments of a university. On further inspection, the constraints of every department were strikingly different from each other. The solver class to be successful must accommodate such diversities and still generate optimal results. It was successfully able to handle all the hard constraints and optimize for almost all the soft constraints. This solution can be applied to a wide variety of real-world scheduling problems with the capability of add-on features.",

The application will specify various things such as the placement of the nodes, the type of nodes to be used, etc. Wireless Sensor Network node placement models are proposed which concentrate on one specific parameter viz., lifetime, latency and reliability. The user can choose the type of model according to his needs and the simulation is done accordingly.
